		<p>This story takes place when it was very often challenging the patience: when nobody realized until later that you collect  what you sow.</p>
		<p>Once, there was a young and unnamed person from a poor family, who they would spend their lonely days and nights beside a lake.</p>
		<p>A lake, lonely as them, with no fishes to swim nor algae to spin.
</p>
		<p>It was a strange connection with both: nobody was there to admire the beauty that it was.
</p>
		<p>The lake was flowing and had a beautiful color that even sapphires couldn’t imitate,
</p>
		<p>and the young person had a heart of gold that even the merciful people wanted to have.
</p>
		<p>On a sunny day, when the sun smiled upon the land, the unnamed person looked upon the lake. In hopes of seeing new tadpoles or fishes decorating the lake, they glanced. But there was nothing. Only the reflection of the unnamed face.</p>
		<p>A heavy sigh could be heard. "When will the misery leave and the flourishing future arrive?"
</p>
		<p>The young person will then distract their pain by watching the birds chirp.
</p>
		<p>The birds were beautiful and colorful; singing a happy tune, forming the lovely nature’s choir.
</p>
		<p>Among the chirping, heavy steps approached. People wouldn’t visit the lake very often, so it was weird.
</p>
		<p>“Being very impatient, I suppose?”
</p>
		<p>The unnamed didn’t answer. They wanted to see the reflection of the  unknown, but it was far away.</p>
		<p>“I’ve been patient long enough. I think it’s time for my reward.”
</p>
		<p>The strange entity took out a silk handkerchief and offered a deal: if they blindfolded themselves with that handkerchief, everything that they desired would become true. </p>
		<p>All the suffering will go away and the sunshine that they wished for will greet them with a smile.</p>
		<p>Before accepting the offer, the young had a vision where a house was on fire, but it didn’t matter because the “true joy” was in front of them.
</p>
		<p>Days would become weeks of fun. Weeks would become months of glory.
</p>
		<p>Dancing and spinning in a limbo of euphoria and magical bliss, the unnamed forgot all of their worries and danced along with the entity, who it was what every person would desire to have in their life.
</p>
		<p>Tasting delicacies, wearing the best costumes, feeling the power of adoration, feeling beautiful and enjoying tea parties while chit chatting was a daily thing. It was a feeling that the young person didn’t feel in all of their life.</p>
		<p>But, in all the fun, a smell of ash invaded their nose. It was confusing.
</p>
		<p>The smell wasn’t very strong, so the young didn’t bother to think about it a second time.</p>
		<p>The months of glory turned into a whole year of fun, which the unnamed cherished a lot.
</p>
		<p>Until one day, they asked why the sun’s color became an orange tint.
</p>
		<p>The dear entity frowned and exclaimed: “Orange? The sun is yellow and it always has been yellow.”
</p>
		<p>To verify that, they took the blind off and looked around. But they couldn’t. It was dim dark gray. Only a horned black figure could be distinguished.</p>
		<p>“You should have done that way too long ago. Foolish.”
</p>
		<p>Then, the horned thing flew away while bursting in laughter.
</p>
		<p>In all of the confusion, that smell of ash became strong and very real. 
</p>
		<p>Thoughts and pictures striked their poor mind. 
</p>
		<p>While having in mind the path to their house, they ran and ran. Tripping, stumbling and falling because of the dark in their eyes, they managed to get where once it was their family’s house.
</p>
		<p>It was burning. Sound of sizzling fire covered their ears. “What just happened? What caused this?”
</p>
		<p>The thoughts and pictures were formed and terrified the unnamed’s spine.
</p>
		<p>Kneeling and crying, a familiar voice approached them.
</p>
		<p>“You could have avoided all this disaster. You left us over nothing.”
</p>
		<p>That familiar voice was from someone from their family. A poor and sick family, but always friendly.
</p>
		<p>Now that friendly tone spoke nothing but hatred. Every joy that once was on that voice left.
</p>
		<p>It was too much pain. Too much hate. Everyone from that family was now against them. 
</p>
		<p>They didn’t take responsibility and left for a fake joy that happy home.
</p>
		<p>Then, crying and screaming from deep guiltiness, they ran to the woods to escape that agony. It was so much that they couldn’t believe it actually happened.</p>
		<p>Instead, they actually left their family for fun that didn't even exist. What they did was unforgivable. Not even the merciful people could forgive them for abandoning such people.
</p>
		<p>Stumbling across a rock path, a humming of an old man could be heard. He was watering flowers.
</p>
		<p>“Old man—they shouted—old man, please, end what my mother once started, I can’t continue living with this guilt. I’m begging you, old man.”
</p>
		<p>In all the despair, the man put two and two together with all the words and sobs that they were shouting.</p>
		<p>At the end, he was mad but empathic at the same time. He forgave many people, but that unnamed person was hard to forgive.
</p>
		<p>Many theorize for what verdict he decided upon that blameable soul, but none of them seem to be true.
</p>
		<p>What was sure was that he sculpted a statue in honor of their soul.</p>
		<p>A crying somebody with their palms together, with tears rolling down their face.
</p>
		<p>There were people now and then that prayed and wished for a piece of that pity that the old man had.
</p>
		<p>But, since that, the ashes of that burnt house made the sun frown and clouds cry.
</p>
		<p>Since then, the sun didn’t smile once more upon that burnt land.
